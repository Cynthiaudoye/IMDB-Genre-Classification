# üé¨ Multimodal IMDB Genre Classification with TensorFlow and Keras

## üìå Project Overview
This project explores **multimodal film genre classification** using **both textual (NLP) and visual (image) data** from the IMDB dataset. The approach leverages:
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for classifying film genres based on **movie posters** (image classification).
- **Bidirectional LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)** for classifying genres using **film overviews** (text classification).

This project was completed as part of my **MSc Data Science coursework** at the **University of Hertfordshire**, exploring deep learning applications in NLP and computer vision.

## üî• Challenges & Future Work
### **Challenges Faced**
1. **Class Imbalance:** Certain genres like "Music" were underrepresented, leading to misclassifications.
2. **Overfitting:** Dropout layers were used to regularize the CNN and LSTM models.
3. **Feature Representation:** CNN struggled to differentiate between similar genres visually.

### **Potential Improvements**
‚úî Use **ResNet** instead of CNN for better image feature extraction.  
‚úî Fine-tune **Transformer-based models (BERT, ViT)** for enhanced text/image understanding.  
‚úî Implement **multi-label classification techniques** to improve genre predictions.
